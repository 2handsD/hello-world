# hello-world
following an introductory github tutorial here

I am Dennis. I am working to become a software developer. I previously worked for 11 years in banking, but I'm attracted to the type of innovation and problem solving that is involved in coding. I'm in OSU's online post-baccalaureate computer science program. I'll have my degree in about another year and a half.
